## Tic Tac

Great App! I think you really took this project and ran with it. You're going
to be a strong developer. There are more things we are going to learn that will
improve your abilities, such as handlebars, jade, node, express, ect. I feel
what your lacking occssionally is knowledge of standards and familar patterns.
A good rule of thumb is that if you find you're repeating something there is
usually a better way to do it.  In general a great project.  You should be proud
of this.
